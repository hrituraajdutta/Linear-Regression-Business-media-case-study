# Linear-Regression-Business-media-case-study With Upgrad
This is a case study that helps us understand what are the variables that effect the viewership of a show on a media platform 
and help make a  liner regression between the views on the views of the show and the variables like  marketing_of_the_show,
presence of  a certain character, simultaneous ongoing competition shows(eg cricket), lag_views, etc.
We deal with the multicollinearity of the input variables and ultimately arrive at the best fit model and compare its results
to a previously created model and ultimately infer from the story it tells us.
This project is in relation to Data Analytics Course on upgrad.
